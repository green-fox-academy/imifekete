        Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve<br>
        Classic Race Champion.
      </h3>
        <p class="small-letters">
          In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a
          Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of<br> 588 mph top speed.
          Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever
          win by a human.<br> Generated documented company revenue of over
          59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.

        Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects
      </h3>
        <p class="small-letters">
          During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in
          charge of large capital construction projects<br> for the Deep
          Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in
          0 BBY by annihilating<br> Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in
          the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power
          of<br> the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine
          before losing both projects to run-away photon<br> torpedoes.
